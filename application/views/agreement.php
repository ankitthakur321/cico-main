                                                    The Hotel will provide access to the required information with respect to the availability of its rooms, the services and amenities, and their rates to Facilitators and its Affiliates on a direct connection (API Linking), through a third party channel manager or a similar interface, extranet or reserve certain rooms for booking through Facilitators as may be decided between the Parties. This will enable the Facilitators and their Affiliates to host the availability of the Hotel&rsquo;s rooms on their websites and other online and offline sales channels (including mobile applications or browsers, branch offices, b2b partners etc.). Accordingly, all benefits, rights and obligations under the Agreement will apply to each Affiliate as if the Affiliate is a contracting party to the Agreement. It is hereby clarified that an Affiliate can issue Hotel vouchers (confirming the booking), issue invoice(s) to the Hotel for its commission, receive booking confirmation and collect accommodation charges (inclusive of all fees and taxes) on behalf of the Hotel. However, the invoice capturing the tax details for hotel accommodation services shall, in all cases, be generated and issued by Hotel directly on the customer for the gross amount collected by the Facilitators towards the booking. Facilitators are not required to issue an &lsquo;invoice&rsquo; (capturing tax details) for the Hotel accommodation services on customers under any circumstances unless law specifically requires Facilitators to do so. Further, the tax charged in respect of Hotel accommodation services shall be discharged by the Hotel in all cases where Hotel is registered under the respective tax laws. For the purpose of this Agreement, Affiliates includes persons which are controlled by, or Control, or under common Control of a person in whose context the word Affiliate is being determined. Control means ability to, directly or indirectly, direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.
